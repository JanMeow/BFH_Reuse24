BFH 24 Spring Studio â€“ Scripts Development

This repository contains 
1. WEb page for materials library for a soon-to-be deconstructured  building by Roche
2. a collection of scripts developed for the BFH 24 Spring Studio, focused on transforming structural line inputs into a graph-based data structure and querying a database for the closest matching components.

Key Features:
Graph-Based Transformation: Converts input structural lines into a graph representation for further processing.
Database Querying: Matches line segment dimensions against a database to find the closest reusable components.
Multiple Transformation Methods:
Top-Down Approach: Utilizes a greedy algorithm to generate structures based on available components.
Bottom-Up Approach: Allows users to define structures and desired building components, which are then matched to potential configurations.
These scripts facilitate the exploration of different reuse strategies in architectural design by integrating computational methods for material and structural optimization.
